# RAG Bot Implementation Summary

## Overview

This implementation enhances the AI Tutor RAG application with the following major improvements:

1. **Fixed PDF Processing Error**: Resolved the "slice indices must be integers" error by ensuring all slice indices are integers.
2. **RAG Process Terminal**: Added a real-time terminal-like interface that shows the RAG process steps.
3. **Session-Based Document Management**: Implemented session isolation to clear previous documents for each new session.
4. **WebSocket Integration**: Added real-time updates between frontend and backend using WebSockets.
5. **Enhanced Document Processing**: Fixed and improved document processing with better error handling.

## Key Components

### Frontend

1. **RAGTerminal Component**:
   - Displays real-time process updates in a terminal-like interface
   - Shows timestamps, process phases, and status messages
   - Can be minimized/maximized

2. **RAGProcess Context**:
   - Manages RAG process events across the application
   - Provides WebSocket integration for real-time updates
   - Handles session management

3. **ChatInterface Updates**:
   - Integration with the RAG process events system
   - Clear indication of processing status for documents
   - Better error handling and user feedback

### Backend

1. **Session-Based Vector Store**:
   - Each new document upload creates a fresh vector store
   - Previous documents are not carried over to new sessions
   - Organized storage for better isolation

2. **Enhanced Error Handling**:
   - Better handling of PDF processing errors
   - Fallback mechanisms for web page extraction
   - Detailed error logging and reporting

3. **WebSocket API**:
   - Real-time event broadcasting
   - Connection management
   - Bidirectional communication between frontend and backend

4. **Event Logging System**:
   - Centralized event logging for RAG processes
   - Structured event types and process phases
   - Asynchronous event broadcasting

## Workflow

1. **Document Upload/URL Processing**:
   - Frontend initiates a new session
   - Backend processes document and logs events
   - Real-time updates sent via WebSocket
   - Terminal displays extraction, chunking, embedding and storage phases

2. **Query Processing**:
   - User submits a question
   - Backend searches the vector store for relevant chunks
   - LLM generates an answer based on retrieved context
   - Terminal displays retrieval and generation phases

## How to Test

1. Start the backend server with `uvicorn app.main:app --reload`
2. Start the frontend with `npm run dev` in the frontend directory
3. Upload a PDF document or enter a URL
4. Observe the terminal showing real-time processing steps
5. Ask questions about the uploaded content
6. See detailed RAG process information in the terminal

## Future Improvements

1. Add more detailed metrics about embedding quality
2. Implement document version tracking for better context
3. Add system to compare different chunking strategies
4. Improve the UI for better visualization of retrieval relevance
5. Add user authentication for session persistence
